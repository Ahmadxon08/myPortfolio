              I'm a front end developer (React.js ) with a focus on creating
              (and occasionally designing) exceptional digital experiences that
              are fast, accessible, visually appealing, and responsive. Even
              though I have been creating web applications for over a year, I
              still love it as if it was something new.

                I'm a passionate, self-proclaimed designer who specializes in
                front end development (React.js ). I am very enthusiastic about
                bringing the technical and visual aspects of digital products to
                life. User experience, pixel perfect design, and writing clear,
                readable, highly performant code matters to me.
              </p>
              <p>
                I began my journey as a web developer in 2023, and since then,
                I've continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new
                challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way.
                Now, in my early thirties, a years after starting my web
                development journey, I'm building cutting-edge web applications
                using modern technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript,
                Tailwindcss, Supabase and much more.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on
                products end to end, from ideation all the way to development.
